---------------------------------------------

Explain the entire java life cycle.
Ans:
1. Editor
    Use a text-editor (notepad, wordpad, etc) to type the program. After completon of editing, then save the file.
    Ensure you save the file in .java extension.
2. Compiling the Source Code
    Use javac (name of the Java compiler). The input to the compiler is the Java source code.
    The file generated after compilation is the .class file.
3. Executing the byte code
    The bytecode generated by the compiler is then executed by jvm (Java Virtual Machine)
    (bytecode refers to the .class)
    Input to the JVM is bytecode and output is machine code which will be executed by the CPU of the local machine
-------------------------------------------
what is class?
Ans: A Class is a blueprint of Object creation in order to write and execute code
-------------------------------------------
What is object?
Ans: An Object is an instance of a class. It defines the characteristics of the class.
--- you can remember it as states and behaviors where state = variables, and behaviors = methods
-------------------------------------------
What is the entry point of an application?
Ans: The main method. When JVM is instructed to run an application by specifying its class, it will look for the main method with the signature of psvm.
-------------------------------------------
Why main is static?
Ans: Java main() method is ALWAYS static to the compiler is able to call it without the creation of an Object
OR before the creation of an object of the class.
The main method is the starting point from where execution starts, so JVM can call main without creating an instance of the class.
-------------------------------------------
Which class is the superclass of all classes?
Ans: Object class in Java language. It is the superclass of the class hierarchy in Java.
